# facebookInspect

The shared way to inspect a page (one launch, one step at a time, readings,
goals and findings) is `skills/inspect/SKILL.md`. This is what only applies
on Facebook.

## The routine on Facebook

```bash
# terminal 1 (or Monitor): the browser stays open until `do stop` or 30 idle minutes
log inspect start --account <a> --url https://www.facebook.com/me 2>&1 | tee <log>

# terminal 2: one step at a time
log inspect do snapshot
log inspect do goto https://www.facebook.com/me
log inspect do click e12 --live        # only when the owner asked
log inspect do stop
```

## Worked examples

A goal, in plain words:

```bash
log inspect start --account <a> --goal "Set the Marketplace location to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania" --detach
```

The goal is judged across the session: on Bethlehem's likes run ("Like 2 to
3 posts"), the first like reads "not reached" (100%) and the second
"reached" (78%).

A finding, as P.E.E.:

```bash
log inspect finding --account <a> --step 04_setlocationBethlehemPa \
  --point "Typing Bethlehem, PA saved the location in the West Bank." \
  --explain "Facebook matched PA to the West Bank, and the account was already in Lima, so the search ranked from Peru."
```

and its fix, once the goal is reached:
`log inspect finding --account <a> --fixes 1 --fix "Typed the state out in full."`

The West Bank step's SubQ reading was about 49,000 tokens.

## Request docs

Rebuild Facebook's request docs after recording or changing a page:
`log facebook capture --docs`.

## The mouse on Facebook

- Facebook's page sends requests all the time; the cursor must not freeze
  for them, only for the first ~2.5 s after a navigation.
- The humanMouse recordings (`skills/humanMouse/SKILL.md`) were made with
  `--url https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/`.
