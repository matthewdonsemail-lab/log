# listingCopy

The rules for a listing's words and photos. They come from what high-response
classified and service ads do, found through TinyFish (rule 53) on 2026-10-23;
the sources and findings are in the workspace's
`RESEARCH/LISTING_COPY_RESEARCH.md` (letters A-F below). The listing's fields
and how its photos reach Facebook are in `docs/listingMedia.md`.

The test under every rule (D): **bad copy describes the seller, good copy
describes the reader's situation.**

## Before writing

Write these down first (D's method):

1. What the reader believes right now, in their words: "My garage is full and I
   don't know who'll take it all."
2. The one thing they should believe after reading: "I send a photo and get a
   price, and they take everything."
3. The objection in the way: price, hassle, trust, time. The copy answers it.

Facts the copy may claim only when matt has said they are true: same-day
pickup, licensed, insured, the towns served, each price. If one isn't known,
leave it out; never guess it (E: be honest).

## Title

| Rule | ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The exact service, the city, one real benefit (A, B, C) | `Junk Removal Bethlehem PA – Free Quote From a Photo` | `Junk Removal & Cleanouts: Houses, Garages, Basements` (no city, no benefit, a list of places) |
| Under about 70 characters, so it isn't cut off (A); 100 is Facebook's limit (`validateListing`) | `Garage & Basement Cleanouts Bethlehem – Same-Day Pickup` (55) | a title that runs past 70 and loses its end in search |
| The words people search with (A) | `junk removal`, `haul away`, `cleanout` | `residential debris solutions`, `decluttering services` |
| No caps, no hype words, no symbol strings (E, F, A) | `Junk Removal Bethlehem PA – Free Quote` | `JUNK REMOVAL!!! ⭐ CHEAP ⭐ WOW` |
| One service per listing (B, A, E) | `Hoarder Cleanouts Bethlehem PA – Free Quote` | `We Do Everything – Junk, Moving, Cleaning, Yard` |

## Description

It answers three questions, in this order (A): what you do, why pick you, how
to get a price.

| Rule | ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open with the reader's situation, not the seller (D) | `Garage you can't park in? Basement full of boxes?` | `Junk removal and full cleanouts in Bethlehem and nearby.` |
| Services as a short list to scan (A, C) | `• Furniture, mattresses, appliances` on its own line, one group a line | one sentence listing nine things |
| Prices as numbers (A, C) | `Small load (a few items): $99` | `Great prices!` / `Call for pricing` |
| Never "cheap"; say "free quote" (B) | `Free quote from a photo` | `Cheapest junk removal in town` / `affordable` |
| Say what happens next (A) | `1. Send a photo 2. Get your price 3. We load, haul and sweep up` | nothing about how it works |
| Credentials and area only if true (A, C) | `Bethlehem, Allentown and Easton` (once matt confirms them) | `Licensed & insured` with no licence |
| The call to action in the reader's words, naming what they get (D, A) | `Send a photo of the pile here and get your price` | `Contact us` / `Inquire within` |
| Plain tone, no exclamation marks (B, D) | `We take it all and leave it swept.` | `Best service ever!!! Don't miss out!!!` |
| Real urgency only, a fact (D) | `Pickup tomorrow if you message today` (only if true) | `Limited time offer!` |
| Paragraphs of two or three lines, no walls of text (A) | short blocks with a blank line between | one 10-line paragraph |
| Spell-checked, one language (E, F) | | typos, mixed languages |

## Photos

| Rule | ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 to 6 photos of real past jobs (A) | the pile, the truck loaded, the room empty | one photo, or stock images |
| The cover is the strongest before-and-after (A, C) | a split before/after of the same room | a logo or a text card |
| Real over made-up: "homeowners can spot fake photos easily" (A) | photos from real jobs | generated images; the Bethlehem listing's two photos are generated (`images.jsonl`) |

How photos are stored, varied and uploaded: `docs/listingMedia.md`.

## Worked example: the Bethlehem listing

**❌ What went up on 2026-10-22** (listing 1425935622848350):

```
Junk Removal & Cleanouts: Houses, Garages, Basements

Junk removal and full cleanouts in Bethlehem and nearby.
Houses, apartments, garages, basements, sheds, storage units, hoarder cleanouts.
We load it, haul it and sweep up. Furniture, appliances, bags, debris.
From $99 for small loads. Message a photo of the job for a quote.
```

What's wrong with it, rule by rule:
- The title has no city and no benefit; it is a list of places.
- The description opens with the seller, not the reader's problem.
- The services are one long sentence of nouns.
- There's one price, and nothing about how it works.
- The call to action, "message a photo", is the best idea in it, but it's buried at the end.

**✅ Rewritten by the rules.** The parts in `[brackets]` need a fact from matt
first; leave a line out if it isn't true.
