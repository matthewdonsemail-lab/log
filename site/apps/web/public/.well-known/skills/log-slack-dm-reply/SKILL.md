# Reading and answering a Slack DM

This is the log play `slack/dmReply`. Before anything else, call the log MCP tool `getGuide({ useCase: "slack/dmReply" })`: it returns this page and makes it the session's play, so every log tool's answer says which step you are on and a send with no play loaded is refused (rules 157, 158). Then follow the steps in order.

Draft every message from that person's own thread and matt's real replies (`voice` with no text, `search`), never from memory, and never send two that read alike (`sameAsSent`).

Read what someone wrote to the account on Slack and answer it in matt's voice, on the account's own session, with no browser.

How the owner asks for it: "read the messages with <someone> on slack", "reply to <someone> on slack", "what did <someone> say in <workspace>"

## Run it from a fresh context

Say: **"go on docs/useCases/slack/dmReply.md for <someone>"**. The agent reads this page and runs the steps.

## The steps


| # | Step | Tool | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | The account is known: a local row with its `d` cookie | `localAccount` { action: "list" }; if missing, the owner runs `log slack cookies save --account <name>` in a terminal | the account is listed |
| 1 | Session check, and which workspaces it is in | `slackSessionCheck`, then `slackWorkspaces` | `loggedIn`, with the workspace's domain |
| 2 | Find the chat by who it is with | `slackChats` { account, workspace } | one DM or group with that person |
| 3 | Read the chat | `slackRead` { account, workspace, chat, limit } | their latest message and what came before it |
| 4 | Pull how matt writes to them, then draft only from facts matt gave | `voice` { to, with, context } (no text) | a draft that answers what they asked |
| 5 | Gate the draft | `voice` { to, with, context, text } | it passes |
| 6 | Send it, one message per line | `slackSendLive` { account, workspace, chat, text, approvedBy: "matt", confirmLive: true } | Slack answers each line with its ts |
| 7 | Tell the owner what they said and what went out | the reply to the owner | both quoted with their times |

New messages arrive by themselves: the inbox hook keeps `log slack watch --inbox` open for every signed-in account and puts each new DM, group message or mention in front of the agent (`>>> NEW SLACK MESSAGE`).

## What the runs taught

- **Read the chat before sending.** The voice gate inside `slackSendLive` reads the chat's context from the .db, not from Slack (rule 137). `slackRead` stores what it reads there as backfill, so step 3 is what gives the gate the chat's history. Once a thank-you was refused three times while the .db held only 2 of the other person's messages, and the gate read it as a cold first message with an ask in it. Backfilled history is never shown as new messages.
- **Send by who it is with.** Give `chat` as the person (their name or handle), not only the D… id, so the gate matches matt's history with them by name.
- **Don't stack messages on a chat matt already answered.** When matt's own messages are the newest in the chat (he has already said thanks), a third message is refused as not his voice, and it reads like it. Answer it with a reaction instead (`slackReactLive`, [inbox/reactions](../log-inbox-reactions/SKILL.md)), or leave it. A 🙏 on a contact's short thank-you went out this way.
