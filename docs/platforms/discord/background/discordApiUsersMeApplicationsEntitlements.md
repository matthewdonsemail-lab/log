Read from each run's own recording (rule 73), secrets and signed link tokens taken out. Kept in `~/.logCli/rea/clientFacts.json`, so it stays after the run is pruned.

## What it does

Lists what the account owns in applications (game or app purchases).

## What our machine does with it

Nothing in log-cli waits for it or reads it. It is part of what Discord's client loads around the page; a watch or a send never depends on it.

## What can go wrong

The account carries on whatever it answers; a failure here changes nothing for our steps.
