### What it sent and what came back (the newest 1 from our runs)

Read from each run's own recording (rule 73), secrets and signed link tokens taken out. Kept in `~/.logCli/rea/clientFacts.json`, so it stays after the run is pruned.

## What it does

Lists the account's saved payment methods for the billing screens.

## What our machine does with it

Never read or used by log-cli; nothing is bought (rule 41).

## What can go wrong

The account carries on whatever it answers; a failure here changes nothing for our steps.
