## What it does

Asks whether to show the account a survey.

## What our machine does with it

Nothing in log-cli waits for it or reads it. It is part of what Discord's client loads around the page; a watch or a send never depends on it.

## What can go wrong

It answered 429 (rate limited) in our run: the client asks often; nothing else is affected.
