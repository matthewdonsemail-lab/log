## What it does

The page tells Facebook which of its keys it holds in browser storage. Seen only on checkpoint and captcha pages (one run).

## What our machine does with it

Nothing. Browser storage is saved back to Twenty after a run (only while it still holds a Facebook login).

## What can go wrong

Only seen inside checkpoints, so it may be part of how Facebook checks the browser during one. Not enough sightings yet to say more; read it again if a checkpoint repeats.
