## What it does

Preloads search suggestions for the search box. Loads on every signed-in page.

## What our machine does with it

Nothing. It is part of the page around our flow; no state of `marketplace/connect` or `marketplace/publish` waits for it or reads it.

## What can go wrong

Nothing for our flow. Watch it only for change: if it disappears from a page where it always loads, or starts returning errors, the page did not load normally, and that is worth reading back (rule 25).
