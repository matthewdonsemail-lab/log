# linkedin

A LinkedIn account's session: saving its cookies from a masked prompt and checking them with LinkedIn.

Written by `bun run docs:build` from the code, the skills and AGENTS.md. Not edited by hand: change the command's usage, its skill or the rule, and rebuild.

## The tools in this guide

Each tool's own description carries its full usage, notes, live line and rules; `logGet` gives its exact inputs and a call that works.

| Tool | What it does | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `linkedinSessionCheck` | Check that LinkedIn still accepts one account's saved session… | `log linkedin session check --account <accountName> [--json]` |

## The rules these tools fall under

Each by its number and first line. The full text is in AGENTS.md (`log://agents`); the core rules are in full in `getGuide({ topic: "logMcpInstructions" })`.
