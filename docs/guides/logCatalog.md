# logCatalog

Finding and running any log command with three tools: logSearch by what you want done, logGet for its inputs and a call that works, logCall to run it.

## logCatalog

Three tools reach every log command: find it by the job, read it, run it.

### 1. Find it: `logSearch`

Say what you want done, in plain words. A platform name narrows it.

```
logSearch { "query": "send a dm on x" }
```

```
query: send a dm on x
verdict: strong
results[8]{id,summary,acts}:
  twitter.dm,"Send one approved direct message on X, …",live
  twitter.dms,"Read an X account's direct messages, …",no
  …
help[1]:
  - logGet {"id":"twitter.dm"}   (its inputs and a call that works)
```

- **verdict:** `strong` means the first result does every word. `closest` means none does all of it, and these do most of it. `none` means nothing fits: the near misses show which words they missed. Say the job differently, or with fewer words.
- **acts:**
  - `no` only reads.
  - `live` has a live run that acts on the platform.
  - `write`, `browser` or `delete` change local data, Twenty or the account's browser.
  - `terminal` is a prompt the owner runs in a terminal, never over MCP.

### 2. Read it: `logGet`

```
logGet { "id": "twitter.dm" }
```

It answers:

- **inputs**, required first, each with its type and a note;
- **call**, a `logCall` line that works, and **live**, the same as a live run, when the command has one;
- **cli**, the same command in a terminal;
- **guide**, the command's guide, to load before first using it;
- **rules**, the AGENTS.md rules the command falls under.

A wrong id gets `didYouMean`.

### 3. Run it: `logCall`

```
logCall { "id": "twitter.dm", "inputs": { "account": "yourAccount", "userId": "12345", "text": "hello" } }
```

- It runs the command through its own tool, so every check still applies: the voice gate, the play, claims, the governor and jobs.
- An unknown input is refused by name, with the inputs it takes. Nothing runs.
- `live: true` runs the live form. It needs `confirmLive: true`, and only when the owner asked for this live run (rule 8).
- `confirmBypass: true` is only for a run outside the account's hours that the owner asked for.
- A long run comes back as a job after `waitMs`. Follow it with `jobStatus`, and watch `tail -f ~/.logCli/mcp/<day>.log` while it runs (rule 26).

### Ids

An id is `<platform>.<command>.<form words>`: `twitter.dm`, `twitter.queue.build`, `facebook.read.members`, `discord.session.check`. A command for any platform has no platform: `localAccount.add`, `search`, `inbox.claim`.

Each command's own tool, such as `twitterDm` or `twitterDmLive`, still works. `logCall` reaches the same tools.
