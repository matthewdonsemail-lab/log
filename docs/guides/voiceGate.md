# voiceGate

The voice gate every send as the owner passes on every platform: a draft checked against the owner's own writing before it goes out, and the voice and AI-tells indexes behind it.

Load next, when the work needs it: getGuide({ topic: "inbox" }) (Every platform's chats as one inbox: listing and reading them, who waits on a reply, claiming a chat before acting in it, and every action's log).

Written by `bun run docs:build` from the code, the skills and AGENTS.md. Not edited by hand: change the command's usage, its skill or the rule, and rebuild.

## The tools in this guide

Each tool's own description carries its full usage, notes, live line and rules; `logGet` gives its exact inputs and a call that works.

| Tool | What it does | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `voice` | Gate a draft against the owner's own writing guide with SubQ before… | `log voice --to <handle> [--text "<draft>"] [--context "<what they said>"] [--with <person or chat>] [--spoken] [--json]` |
| `voiceAiIndex` | Build the AI tells index with Jina and measure the owner's own… | `log voice aiIndex [--json]   (builds the AI tells index: every literal phrase in vendor/aiTells, tbhb/vale-ai-tells first and then the other lists, embedded with Jina (JINA_API_KEY), with the owner's own replies from the voice index measured against it for their p50 and p99 closeness, and the vale rules they use themselves muted; the gate builds it itself when it is missing or older than the voice index; rule 137)` |
| `voiceIndex` | Build the owner's voice per chat and person from the conversations… | `log voice index [--json]   (builds the owner's voice from every conversation log search already saved, reading nothing new: each of the owner's replies paired with what was said just before it, embedded with log search's own model, and a profile per chat, person and platform counted from the owner's own messages)` |
